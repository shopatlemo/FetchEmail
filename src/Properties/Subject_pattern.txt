# PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS COMMENTS, NO BLANK LINES
# This is a metadata file that contains the Subject matching
# Each line starts with a Subject to tell the system on what subject from the email to be parsed
# File is delimited by |
# Column 0 --> Subject
# Column 1 --> eMail Originator (Ebay/Paypal or Amazon)
# Column 2 --> Primary Index Indicator (derived by person, MUST be unique)
# Column 3 --> Subject from email are delimited by space, and they will be converted to an array.  We are telling the system on what array position should 
#              be taken to check our parser
# Column 4 --> What subject to check based on Column 3 values
# Column 5 --> What values can be taken and assigned to a variable found from variable_pattern.txt
#              Syntax is <variable_name> = <Position>, position can be a number or certain key words such as last, last-1, 1 to last etc.  If no variables can be derived, then just blank it.
# Column 6 --> Some times, values derived from subject may contain unwanted characters.  The remove=<what charcters can be removed> should be passed.  If nothing to be removed,
#              then leave it as blank
# Column 7 --> will tell what kind of transaction was that (e.g dispute, cancel_order, refund etc). 
# Once the subject passes the test, it also tells what values that we can derive from the subject
# PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS, NO BLANK LINES
